## Decrease and conquer

### The steps of the decrease-and-conquer algorithm
Generally, the decrease-and-conquer approach implies the following three steps:
1. Decrease: reduce a problem to a smaller instance of the same problem.
2. Conquer: iteratively or recursively solve the sub-problem.
3. Extend: apply the sub-problem solution to the next sub-problem to get a solution to the original problem.

## Divide and conquer

### The steps of a divide-and-conquer-based algorithm
A typical algorithm based on the divide and conquer paradigm consists of three steps:

+ Divide: split a problem into smaller sub-problems of the same type. Each sub-problem should represent a part of the original problem.
+ Conquer: recursively solve the sub-problems. If they are simple enough, solve them directly using base case conditions.
+Combine: unite the solutions of the sub-problems to get the solution for the original problem.
