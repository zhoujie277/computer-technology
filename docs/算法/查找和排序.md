#### Jump Search
+ We use jump search to find an element's position in a sorted array;
+ The algorithm divides the array into several blocks and compares the right border of the blocks sequentially with the target element, in order to find the block that might contain it; then it performs backward linear search within that block to find the target element;
+ It's time complexity is O(sqrt(n)).

```c++
    function jump_search(array, value):
    step = floor(sqrt(len(array)))              // step to move to the next block (rounding the value of the 
                                                // square root of the length of the array to a smaller integer)
    curr = 1                                    // index of the current element (the check starts from 1)
    while curr <= len(array):                   // loop while the index is not bigger than the length of the array
        if array[curr] == value then            // if the current value is equal to the target value
            return curr                         // return the index
        elif array[curr] > value then           // else if the current value is greater than the target one
            ind = curr - 1                      // we start the search inside the block from the end of the block
                                                // the starting index is to the left of the right border of the block (curr)
            while ind > curr-step and ind >= 1: // while the new index has not gone beyond the left border 
                                                // of the block (curr-step) or array (1)
                if array[ind] == value then     // if the current value is equal to the target value
                    return ind                  // return the index
                ind = ind - 1                        // reducing the index of the current element
            return -1                           // the target value is not in the array, so return -1
        curr = curr + step                            // increasing the index of the current element by a step 
                                                // to move to the next block
    ind = len(array)                            // start checking the last block (if its length has turned out to be less)
                                                // the starting index is equal to the last one
    while ind > curr-step:                      // while the new index has not gone beyond the left border of the block (curr-step)
        if array[ind] == value then             // if the current value is equal to the target value
            return ind                          // return the index
        ind = ind - 1                                // reducing the index of the current element
    return -1                                   // the target value is not in the array, so return -1
```

#### Binary Search
Binary search is a fast algorithm for finding an element in a sorted array. The algorithm runs in logarithmic time, making O(\log n)O(logn) comparisons, where n is the length of the input array.

The algorithm begins by comparing the middle array element with the target value. If there is a match, it returns the element index. Otherwise, the search proceeds to the left or right subarray, depending on whether the target value is less or greater than the middle element. It goes on until it finds the target value or a new search interval is empty.

##### Pseudocode of the binary search function

```c++
function found_binary(array, value):
    left = 1                            // the starting value of the left border
    right = len(array)                  // the starting value of the right border
    while left <= right:                // while the left border is to the left 
                                        // of the right one (or if they match)
        middle = (left+right) // 2      // finding the middle of the array (removing 
                                        // the fractional part)
        if array[middle] == value then  // if the value from the middle of the array 
                                        // is equal to the target one
            return middle               // returning the index of this element
        elif array[middle] > value then // else if the value from the middle is greater 
                                        // than the target one
            right = middle - 1          // setting a new value to the right border (the one 
                                        // to the left of the middle one)
        else:                           // else (if the value from the middle is less than 
                                        // the target one)
            left = middle + 1           // setting a new value to the left border (the one 
                                        // to the right of the middle one)
    return -1                           // if the value is not found, we return -1
```

## 排序

### Bubble sort
The algorithm is called "bubble sort" because it moves the smallest or largest elements to the end of the array. It compares adjacent elements in pairs and swaps them if they are in the wrong order.

Although bubble sort is one of the simplest sorting algorithms to understand and implement, its Ο(n^2) complexity means that its efficiency decreases dramatically on arrays that contain many elements.

### Quick sort
Quicksort is an efficient in-place sorting algorithm that is often faster in practice compared to other sorting algorithms. The algorithm is based on the divide-and-conquer paradigm.

Here are the steps of quicksort:

+ Pick some element from the array. We will call that element a pivot.
+ Reorder the array so that all values smaller than the pivot are positioned before it and all larger values come after; values equal to the pivot can go either way.
+ Recursively sort the subarrays of smaller and greater elements.

The base case of recursion is arrays the size of zero or one, which is in order by definition, so they never need to be sorted.

Quicksort can be implemented as a recursive or iterative algorithm. Here we will consider only the recursive version.

The time complexity is O(nlogn) in the average case, and O(n^2) in the worst case, but fortunately, it is usually average. We will consider some bad cases later.

Note, there are a lot of modifications that make the algorithm more efficient. The pivot selection and partitioning steps can be implemented in different ways. The choice of a specific implementation strategy greatly affects the algorithm's performance.

#### Choosing a pivot
Your choice of pivot strongly affects the sorting time. It's quite difficult to determine a good pivot for all arrays.

The best pivot would divide the array into two equal parts, which would halve the problem size. However, this means that the pivot is the median of the elements, and in order to find the median, we would either need to use an already sorted array or a more complex approach to find the median.

Here are some possible methods of choosing the pivot:

+ Pick the leftmost or the rightmost element;
+ Pick the middle element;
+ Pick a random element;
+ Take the first, middle and last value of the array and choose the median of these three numbers as the pivot.
